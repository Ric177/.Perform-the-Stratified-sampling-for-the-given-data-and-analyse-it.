we are to carry out a hypothetical housing quality survey across Lagos state, Nigeria.
And we looking at a total of 5000 houses (hypothetically). We donâ€™t just go to one local
government and select 5000 houses, rather we ensure that the 5000 houses are a
representative of the whole 20 local government areas Lagos state is comprised of. This
is called stratified sampling. The population is divided into homogenous strata and the
right number of instances is sampled from each stratum to guarantee that the test-set
(which in this case is the 5000 houses) is a representative of the overall population. If
we used random sampling, there would be a significant chance of having bias in the
survey results.
